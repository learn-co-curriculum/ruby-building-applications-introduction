# Introduction to Configuring Ruby Applications

There are a number of outside resources we can leverage in working with our Ruby
applications. For example, RSpec is a Ruby-specific library, or _gem_. We
leverage this testing tool for behavior-driven testing. As we start to build out
more complex applications, it's standard to utilize libraries and other
conventions for setting up Ruby applications. This will not only save time, but
will also offer a common template that is familiar to Ruby developers.

We'll cover topics including:

- What is Bundler?
- What is a gem?
- How do gems work?
- What is `require`?
- Why do we use `require_relative`?

In the next couple of lessons, we'll explain these tools and concepts that have
been designed for efficiency.
